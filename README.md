## What it does
This is a Java program which reads in a CSV and determines whether the homebuyers listed are eligible to buy a house.

## How we built it
We built this with java

## Challenges we ran into
We wrote lots of code, but what we were ultimately able to complete and present within the timeframe was less that what we were hoping. 

## What we learned
We learned a lot about Java, managing our time, as well as other technologies that we studied along the way as we brainstormed how to approach this project.
